"""
When you see me write formatter.format(...) Iâ€™m telling python to do the following:
1. Take the formatter string defined on line 1.
2. Call its format function, which is similar to telling it to do a command line command named
format.
3. Pass to format four arguments, which match up with the four {}s in the formatter variable.
This is like passing arguments to the command line command format.
4. The result of calling format on formatter is a new string that has the {} replaced with the
four variables. This is what print is now printing out.
